## What is SyntheticData?

SyntheticData is a configurable synthetic data generator that produces realistic, interconnected enterprise financial data. It generates General Ledger journal entries, Chart of Accounts, SAP HANA-compatible ACDOCA event logs, document flows, subledger records, banking/KYC/AML transactions, OCEL 2.0 process mining data, audit workpapers, and ML-ready graph exports at scale.

The generator produces statistically accurate data based on empirical research from real-world general ledger patterns, ensuring that synthetic datasets exhibit the same characteristics as production data—including Benford's Law compliance, temporal patterns, and document flow integrity.

**New in v0.2.0:** Privacy-preserving fingerprint extraction from real data with differential privacy guarantees.

### Privacy-Preserving Fingerprinting

- **Fingerprint Extraction**: Extract statistical properties from real data into `.dsf` files
- **Differential Privacy**: Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with configurable epsilon budget
- **K-Anonymity**: Suppression of rare categorical values below configurable threshold
- **Privacy Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all privacy decisions and epsilon spent
- **Fidelity Evaluation**: Validate synthetic data matches original fingerprint (KS, Wasserstein, Benford MAD)
- **Gaussian Copula**: Preserve multivariate correlations during synthesis

### Production Features

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/ey-asu-rnd/SyntheticData.git
cd SyntheticData
cargo build --release

# Run demo mode
./target/release/datasynth-data generate --demo --output ./output

# Or create a custom configuration
./target/release/datasynth-data init --industry manufacturing --complexity medium -o config.yaml
./target/release/datasynth-data generate --config config.yaml --output ./output
```

### Fingerprinting (New in v0.2.0)

```bash
# Extract fingerprint from real data with privacy protection
./target/release/datasynth-data fingerprint extract \
    --input ./real_data.csv \
    --output ./fingerprint.dsf \
    --privacy-level standard

# Validate fingerprint integrity
./target/release/datasynth-data fingerprint validate ./fingerprint.dsf

# View fingerprint details
./target/release/datasynth-data fingerprint info ./fingerprint.dsf --detailed

# Evaluate synthetic data fidelity
./target/release/datasynth-data fingerprint evaluate \
    --fingerprint ./fingerprint.dsf \
    --synthetic ./synthetic_data/ \
    --threshold 0.8
```

### Python Wrapper

```python
from datasynth_py import DataSynth
from datasynth_py.config import blueprints

config = blueprints.retail_small(companies=4, transactions=10000)
synth = DataSynth()
result = synth.generate(config=config, output={"format": "csv", "sink": "temp_dir"})
print(result.output_dir)
