# Crate Reference

SyntheticData is organized as a Rust workspace with 15 modular crates. This section provides detailed documentation for each crate.

## Workspace Structure

```
datasynth-cli          → Binary entry point (commands: generate, validate, init, info, fingerprint)
datasynth-server       → REST/gRPC/WebSocket server with auth, rate limiting, timeouts
datasynth-ui           → Tauri/SvelteKit desktop UI
    ↓
datasynth-runtime      → Orchestration layer (GenerationOrchestrator coordinates workflow)
    ↓
datasynth-generators   → Data generators (JE, Document Flows, Subledgers, Anomalies, Audit)
datasynth-banking      → KYC/AML banking transaction generator with fraud typologies
datasynth-ocpm         → Object-Centric Process Mining (OCEL 2.0 event logs)
datasynth-fingerprint  → Privacy-preserving fingerprint extraction and synthesis
    ↓
datasynth-graph        → Graph/network export (PyTorch Geometric, Neo4j, DGL)
datasynth-eval         → Evaluation framework with auto-tuning and recommendations
    ↓
datasynth-config       → Configuration schema, validation, industry presets
    ↓
datasynth-core         → Domain models, traits, distributions, templates, resource guards
    ↓
datasynth-output       → Output sinks (CSV, JSON, Parquet, ControlExport)

datasynth-test-utils   → Testing utilities and fixtures
```

## Dependencies

The crates follow a strict dependency hierarchy:

1. **datasynth-core**: No internal dependencies (foundation)
2. **datasynth-config**: Depends on datasynth-core
3. **datasynth-output**: Depends on datasynth-core
4. **datasynth-generators**: Depends on datasynth-core, datasynth-config
5. **datasynth-graph**: Depends on datasynth-core, datasynth-generators
6. **datasynth-eval**: Depends on datasynth-core
7. **datasynth-banking**: Depends on datasynth-core, datasynth-config
8. **datasynth-ocpm**: Depends on datasynth-core
9. **datasynth-fingerprint**: Depends on datasynth-core, datasynth-config
10. **datasynth-runtime**: Depends on datasynth-core, datasynth-config, datasynth-generators, datasynth-output, datasynth-graph, datasynth-banking, datasynth-ocpm, datasynth-fingerprint, datasynth-eval
11. **datasynth-cli**: Depends on datasynth-runtime, datasynth-fingerprint
12. **datasynth-server**: Depends on datasynth-runtime
13. **datasynth-ui**: Depends on datasynth-runtime (via Tauri)
14. **datasynth-test-utils**: Depends on datasynth-core

## Building Individual Crates

```bash
# Build specific crate
cargo build -p datasynth-core
cargo build -p datasynth-generators
cargo build -p datasynth-fingerprint

# Run tests for specific crate
cargo test -p datasynth-core
cargo test -p datasynth-generators
cargo test -p datasynth-fingerprint

# Generate docs for specific crate
cargo doc -p datasynth-core --open
cargo doc -p datasynth-fingerprint --open
```

## API Documentation

For detailed Rust API documentation, generate and view rustdoc:

```bash
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --open
```

After deployment, API documentation is available at `/api/` in the documentation site.
