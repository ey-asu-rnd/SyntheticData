# Accounting & Audit Standards

SyntheticData includes comprehensive support for major accounting and auditing standards frameworks, enabling the generation of standards-compliant synthetic financial data suitable for audit analytics, compliance testing, and ML model training.

## Overview

The `datasynth-standards` crate provides domain models and generation logic for:

| Category | Standards |
|----------|-----------|
| **Accounting** | US GAAP (ASC), IFRS |
| **Auditing** | ISA (International Standards on Auditing), PCAOB |
| **Regulatory** | SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) |

## Accounting Framework Selection

### Framework Options

```yaml
accounting_standards:
  enabled: true
  framework: us_gaap  # Options: us_gaap, ifrs, dual_reporting
```

| Framework | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `us_gaap` | United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles |
| `ifrs` | International Financial Reporting Standards |
| `dual_reporting` | Generate data for both frameworks with reconciliation |

### Key Framework Differences

The generator automatically handles framework-specific rules:

| Area | US GAAP | IFRS |
|------|---------|------|
| Inventory costing | LIFO permitted | LIFO prohibited |
| Development costs | Generally expensed | Capitalized when criteria met |
| PPE revaluation | Cost model only | Revaluation model permitted |
| Impairment reversal | Not permitted | Permitted (except goodwill) |
| Lease classification | Bright-line tests (75%/90%) | Principles-based |

## Revenue Recognition (ASC 606 / IFRS 15)

Generate realistic customer contracts with performance obligations:

```yaml
accounting_standards:
  revenue_recognition:
    enabled: true
    generate_contracts: true
    avg_obligations_per_contract: 2.0
    variable_consideration_rate: 0.15
    over_time_recognition_rate: 0.30
    contract_count: 100
```

### Generated Entities

- **Customer Contracts**: Transaction price, status, framework
- **Performance Obligations**: Goods, services, licenses with satisfaction patterns
- **Variable Consideration**: Discounts, rebates, incentives with constraint application
- **Revenue Recognition Schedule**: Period-by-period recognition

### 5-Step Model Compliance

The generator follows the 5-step revenue recognition model:
1. Identify the contract
2. Identify performance obligations
3. Determine transaction price
4. Allocate transaction price to obligations
5. Recognize revenue when/as obligations are satisfied

## Lease Accounting (ASC 842 / IFRS 16)

Generate lease portfolios with ROU assets and lease liabilities:

```yaml
accounting_standards:
  leases:
    enabled: true
    lease_count: 50
    finance_lease_percent: 0.30
    avg_lease_term_months: 60
    generate_amortization: true
    real_estate_percent: 0.40
```

### Generated Entities

- **Leases**: Classification, commencement date, term, payments, discount rate
- **ROU Assets**: Initial measurement, accumulated depreciation, carrying amount
- **Lease Liabilities**: Current/non-current portions
- **Amortization Schedules**: Period-by-period interest and principal

### Classification Logic

- **US GAAP**: Bright-line tests (75% term, 90% PV)
- **IFRS**: All leases (except short-term/low-value) recognized on balance sheet

## Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820 / IFRS 13)

Generate fair value measurements across hierarchy levels:

```yaml
accounting_standards:
  fair_value:
    enabled: true
    measurement_count: 30
    level1_percent: 0.60    # Quoted prices
    level2_percent: 0.30    # Observable inputs
    level3_percent: 0.10    # Unobservable inputs
    include_sensitivity_analysis: true
```

### Fair Value Hierarchy

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Level 1 | Quoted prices in active markets | Listed stocks, exchange-traded funds |
| Level 2 | Observable inputs | Corporate bonds, interest rate swaps |
| Level 3 | Unobservable inputs | Private equity, complex derivatives |

## Impairment Testing (ASC 360 / IAS 36)

Generate impairment tests with framework-specific methodology:

```yaml
accounting_standards:
  impairment:
    enabled: true
    test_count: 15
    impairment_rate: 0.20
    generate_projections: true
    include_goodwill: true
```

### Framework Differences

- **US GAAP**: Two-step test (recoverability then measurement)
- **IFRS**: One-step test comparing to recoverable amount

## ISA Compliance (Audit Standards)

Generate audit procedures mapped to ISA requirements:

```yaml
audit_standards:
  isa_compliance:
    enabled: true
    compliance_level: comprehensive  # basic, standard, comprehensive
    generate_isa_mappings: true
    generate_coverage_summary: true
    include_pcaob: true
    framework: dual  # isa, pcaob, dual
```

### Supported ISA Standards

The crate includes 34 ISA standards from ISA 200 through ISA 720:

| Series | Focus Area |
|--------|------------|
| ISA 200-265 | General principles and responsibilities |
| ISA 300-450 | Risk assessment and response |
| ISA 500-580 | Audit evidence |
| ISA 600-620 | Using work of others |
| ISA 700-720 | Conclusions and reporting |

## Analytical Procedures (ISA 520)

Generate analytical procedures with variance investigation:

```yaml
audit_standards:
  analytical_procedures:
    enabled: true
    procedures_per_account: 3
    variance_probability: 0.20
    generate_investigations: true
    include_ratio_analysis: true
```

### Procedure Types

- **Trend analysis**: Year-over-year comparisons
- **Ratio analysis**: Key financial ratios
- **Reasonableness tests**: Expected vs. actual comparisons

## External Confirmations (ISA 505)

Generate confirmation procedures with response tracking:

```yaml
audit_standards:
  confirmations:
    enabled: true
    confirmation_count: 50
    positive_response_rate: 0.85
    exception_rate: 0.10
```

### Confirmation Types

- Bank confirmations
- Accounts receivable confirmations
- Accounts payable confirmations
- Legal confirmations

## Audit Opinion (ISA 700/705/706/701)

Generate audit opinions with key audit matters:

```yaml
audit_standards:
  opinion:
    enabled: true
    generate_kam: true
    average_kam_count: 3
```

### Opinion Types

- Unmodified
- Qualified
- Adverse
- Disclaimer

## SOX Compliance

Generate SOX 302/404 compliance documentation:

```yaml
audit_standards:
  sox:
    enabled: true
    generate_302_certifications: true
    generate_404_assessments: true
    materiality_threshold: 10000.0
```

### Section 302 Certifications

- CEO and CFO certifications
- Disclosure controls effectiveness
- Material weakness identification

### Section 404 Assessments

- ICFR effectiveness assessment
- Key control testing
- Deficiency classification matrix

### Deficiency Classification

The `DeficiencyMatrix` classifies deficiencies based on:

| Likelihood | Magnitude | Classification |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Probable | Material | Material Weakness |
| Reasonably Possible | More Than Inconsequential | Significant Deficiency |
| Remote | Inconsequential | Control Deficiency |

## PCAOB Standards

Generate PCAOB-specific audit elements:

```yaml
audit_standards:
  pcaob:
    enabled: true
    generate_cam: true
    integrated_audit: true
```

### PCAOB-Specific Requirements

- Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) vs. Key Audit Matters (KAMs)
- Integrated audit (ICFR + financial statements)
- AS 2201 ICFR testing requirements

## Evaluation and Validation

The `datasynth-eval` crate includes standards compliance evaluators:

```rust
use datasynth_eval::coherence::{
    StandardsComplianceEvaluation,
    RevenueRecognitionEvaluator,
    LeaseAccountingEvaluator,
    StandardsThresholds,
};

// Evaluate revenue recognition compliance
let eval = RevenueRecognitionEvaluator::evaluate(&contracts);
assert!(eval.po_allocation_compliance >= 0.95);

// Evaluate lease classification accuracy
let eval = LeaseAccountingEvaluator::evaluate(&leases, "us_gaap");
assert!(eval.classification_accuracy >= 0.90);
```

### Compliance Thresholds

| Metric | Default Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|
| PO allocation compliance | 95% |
| Revenue timing compliance | 95% |
| Lease classification accuracy | 90% |
| ROU asset accuracy | 95% |
| Fair value hierarchy compliance | 95% |
| ISA coverage | 90% |
| SOX control coverage | 95% |
| Audit trail completeness | 90% |
