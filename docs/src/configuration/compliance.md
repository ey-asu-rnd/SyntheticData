# Compliance

Compliance settings control fraud injection, internal controls, and approval workflows.

## Fraud Configuration

```yaml
fraud:
  enabled: true
  fraud_rate: 0.005

  types:
    fictitious_transaction: 0.15
    revenue_manipulation: 0.10
    expense_capitalization: 0.10
    split_transaction: 0.15
    round_tripping: 0.05
    kickback_scheme: 0.10
    ghost_employee: 0.05
    duplicate_payment: 0.15
    unauthorized_discount: 0.10
    suspense_abuse: 0.05
```

### Fraud Rate

Overall percentage of fraudulent transactions:

```yaml
fraud:
  enabled: true

### Fraud Patterns

```yaml
fraud:
  patterns:
    threshold_adjacent:
      enabled: true
      threshold: 10000             # Approval threshold
      range: 0.1                   # % below threshold

    time_based:
      weekend_preference: 0.3      # Weekend entry rate
      after_hours_preference: 0.2  # After hours rate

    entity_targeting:
      repeat_offender_rate: 0.4    # Same user commits multiple
```

## Internal Controls Configuration

```yaml
internal_controls:

      type: preventive
      frequency: continuous
      assertions:
        - authorization
        - validity

  sod_rules:
    - conflict_type: create_approve
      processes: [ap_invoice, ap_payment]
```

### Control Definition

```yaml
internal_controls:
  controls:
    - id: "CTL-001"
      name: "Payment Approval"
      description: "Payments require manager approval"
      type: preventive              # preventive, detective
      frequency: continuous         # continuous, daily, weekly, monthly

        - authorization
        - validity
        - completeness
      accounts: ["2000"]            # Applicable accounts
      threshold: 5000               # Trigger threshold

    - id: "CTL-002"
      name: "Journal Entry Review"
      type: detective
      frequency: daily
      assertions:
        - accuracy
        - completeness
```

### Control Types

| Type | Description |

| `preventive` | Prevents errors/fraud before occurrence |
| `detective` | Detects errors/fraud after occurrence |

### Control Assertions

| Assertion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `authorization` | Proper approval obtained |
| `validity` | Transaction is legitimate |
| `completeness` | All transactions recorded |
| `accuracy` | Amounts are correct |
| `cutoff` | Recorded in correct period |
| `classification` | Properly categorized |

### Segregation of Duties

```yaml
internal_controls:
  sod_rules:
    - conflict_type: create_approve
      processes: [ap_invoice, ap_payment]
      description: "Cannot create and approve payments"

    - conflict_type: create_approve
      processes: [ar_invoice, ar_receipt]

    - conflict_type: custody_recording
      processes: [cash_handling, cash_recording]

    - conflict_type: authorization_custody

## Validation

| Check | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `fraud_rate` | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `fraud.types` | Sum = 1.0 |
| `control.id` | Unique |
| `thresholds` | Strictly ascending |
