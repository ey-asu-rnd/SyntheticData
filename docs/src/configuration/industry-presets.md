## Customizing Presets

Start with a preset and customize:

```bash
# Generate preset
datasynth-data init --industry manufacturing -o config.yaml

# Edit config.yaml
# - Adjust transaction counts
# - Add companies
# - Enable additional features

# Validate and generate
datasynth-data validate --config config.yaml
datasynth-data generate --config config.yaml --output ./output
```

## Combining Industries

For conglomerates, use multiple companies with different characteristics:

```yaml
companies:
  - code: "1000"
    name: "Manufacturing Division"
    volume_weight: 0.5

  - code: "2000"
    name: "Retail Division"
    volume_weight: 0.3

  - code: "3000"
    name: "Services Division"
    volume_weight: 0.2
```
